We will be building a React app. Please share your screen now.

Please use the API at https://randomuser.me/ to gather and display a list of 100 random users. Each user should be a clickable link showing the user's full name and login UUID. Upon clicking the user's full name, we should see a basic user profile including:

- profile image (rendered)
- name
- email address

[Tests are always a good idea. Show us how you would test your app.]
